IF ## have cfqueryparam(All Dynamic variables(User Inputs)) 

<legend class="notable-text">Permissions: </legend>
<!--- For the below text, it will display in two separate buttons. If I wanted one button, though it seems to have functionality for both buttons, I could
include both anchor tags in one div. What happens with several? Still good?
Populate buttons with information from database would be fun too, but maybe Js? --->
<div class="d-grid gap-2 col-3 mx-auto btn btn-secondary">
    <a href="addEmp.cfm">Add Employee</a>
</div>
<div class="d-grid gap-2 col-3 mx-auto btn btn-secondary">
    <a href="welcome.cfm">Go Home</a>
</div>

No Logout page?
Empty variables, username can't be modified, address is never shown on full emp screen
            
REQUEST: Probably based on validation !Before insert do cfif username NEQ no numbers validation send with appropriate msg errors if parameter == ? Display error! 
CHECK: Lessons 4 and 5

'Welcome' Doesn't open the first run through or initial private runs (Likely same problem with structstarted not being checked).
This happens a lot, especially when timeout, a similar problem though likely differently sourced, is that when my commandbox has been inactive for some time, the mail server stop
responding.

After Adding bootstrap, my project has a problem logging in a user initially. This was solved after about an hour yesterday, but it happened again today
After going to logout screen, it worked well. Wasn't able to access admin pages. Maybe force logout after a set time would help with this?
A potentially related, and similar issue happens sometimes with css, it doesn't always update immediately. --Do this on server restart, after restarting I had the same
problem

JS Disabled:
Theme button isn't working.
IsActive display not showing

No Logout page?


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Questions --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Insert Parameters to nvarchar? Eg (50) in script? - No

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Consider compound expressions -- 

<cfif structKeyExists( myStruct, 'age' ) AND myStruct.age LTE 7>
    ..code..
</cfif>




The second cfcase declaration above lists more than one value. If the expression is either 9 OR 10, the code will execute. The default delimiter is ','. 
If the value contains a comma, it is automatically treated as a list. If you want the value to include a comma in the string, simply specify an alternate delimiter 
using the delimiters attribute like this:

<cfcase value="9,10" delimiters="|">
    ..code..
</cfcase>
